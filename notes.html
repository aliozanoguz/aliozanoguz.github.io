    <h1>Notes and Summary</h1>

    <h2>AP CSP Big Idea</h2>
    <div class="note-section">
        Here are my notes for the AP CSP College Board:
        - Topic 1.1: Collaboration allows us to take different views and remove bias from our code. There are many ways to collaborate with your partners in coding.
        - Topic 1.2: A computer innovation can be both online or physical. Many of the things we take for granted are computer innovations. To understand these innovations, we must ask questions such as: Why do they exist? What do they solve? And what do they make us do that wasn’t available before? There are many types of input, such as tactile, audible, visual, and text. Text also includes numerical values. Outputs are triggered by inputs. A computer program is a set of statements that are executed according to the rules of programming. Code segments are found in programs.
        - Topic 1.3: Programs are developed with investigators who need to determine the constraints, user concerns, interests, and requirements of a program. Developers brainstorm, then plan, and then develop their programs. Programs are created by teams, and every member of the team deserves credit. We must document whatever we do in case someone needs to find who did what or to give someone credit. Some programming languages offer comments, which helps us document without much trouble
        - Topic 1.4: There are many types of errors: logic errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, and overflow errors. Errors and programming go hand in hand. Errors are part of the process. Logic errors are caused by programmers making a mistake in the algorithm, while syntax errors occur when the typist causes a typo that results in the problem. A runtime error is where the program stops working while running (sometimes known as bugs). This can be caused by dividing by zero, etc. An overflow error is caused when the program tries calculating something that is outside the defined range of values. There are many cases and solutions to fix errors, such as test cases, hand tracing, visualization, debugging, and other output sources. The easiest errors to find and fix are syntax errors, while the hardest are usually logic errors. We can use test methods to solve these errors. Hand tracing is useful for loops and small programs. Programmers start testing when they start programming and begin answering the question of how this might work properly. We must think about what sort of input we could get in our algorithm. Programmers test their programs, then refine them.

    <h2>Big Idea 2</h2>
    <div class="note-section">
        - 2.1
Bits can be used to represent data.
Eight bits make up a byte.
Binary is a two-digit numbering system. The number "1" denotes the presence of an electrical signal in your computer. The number "0" indicates that your computer's electrical signal is off.

2.2
Algorithms for lossless data compression may often lower the amount of bits sent or stored while ensuring that the original data can be fully restored.
Although lossy data compression methods only allow an approximate reconstruction of the original data, they can dramatically reduce the number of bits saved or transferred.
Transmission time and storage space can be reduced by using data compression.

2.3
Problems with data sets include the requirement to merge data sources, clean up data, and deal with inaccurate, incomplete, and incomplete data.

2.4
Information is processed by programs in an interactive, iterative manner so that people may learn more about the data.
Digital data may be cleaned and filtered by programmers using programs.

      Within a program, a variable is an abstraction that has the ability to store a value.
 Variables are used to reference data that is represented by types in some computer languages. These types consist of strings, lists, Booleans, and integers.
 The value that a variable represents can be altered.
 A variable can be given a value by using the "←" operator.


 A popular technique for utilizing natural numbers to refer to the items in a list or string is an index.
 A data type's abstract characteristics and the specifics of its representation are kept apart via data abstraction.
Lists, which enable the bundling of variables like strings, integers, etc., may be used to build data abstraction.
 Creating a program's data abstraction can lead to a program that is easier to develop.
 A finite set of instructions that carry out a certain task is called an algorithm.
 There are several ways to express algorithms, including diagrams, pseudocode, and natural language.
 Sequencing, selection, and iteration may be combined to create any algorithm.Strings, which are characters surrounded by quote marks, are used to represent text. A substring is a portion of an existing string. They are commonly applied to names, words, and phrases. It is possible to split, join, and search strings.
 Boolean Formulas: The phrase "true" or "false" is boolean. Its value can either be "1" or "0". They employ operators like AND, OR, and NOT. They are commonly used in loops and conditionals.

Conditionals are statements used in programming that allow the code to make decisions based on particular conditions. Which code to use—if, else if, and else—depends on whether a given Boolean assertion is true or not. Take action, for example, if one of the following circumstances is true; if another condition is true, take another action; and if none of the criteria are true, take action.
 Nested conditionals are conditionals inside conditionals. This shows that an if, otherwise if, or otherwise sentence contains another conditional. They are used to oversee ever-more complex decision-making processes.Iteration is the process of repeatedly running a portion of an algorithm.
An iteration consists of repeated processes that continue until a condition is fulfilled or for a predetermined number of times.
Iterative statements cycle over actions zero or more times to alter the execution flow.
The body of a repeat till loop does not run if the condition is originally true.
There are several comparable ways to express algorithms.
There are situations where conditional statements and boolean expressions can be used interchangeably.
Using pre-existing algorithms to create new ones lowers complexity, effort, and debugging time.
Only data that is arranged in either ascending or descending order may be searched using binary.
Words can also be arranged alphabetically in data lists.
The way binary search works is that the search range is divided by two.The sum of the top and lowest indices is divided by two to determine the median index.
In general, binary search is more effective than sequential search.
A named set of programming instructions with optional arguments and return values is called a procedure.
Methods and functions are other names for procedures, depending on the programming language.
Arguments define the values of parameters during a procedure call, whereas parameters are inputs to a process.
Using a method by comprehending what it does rather than how it operates is known as procedural abstraction.
It makes it possible to solve big issues by breaking them down into smaller ones and using a process to solve each one.
It is possible to prevent code duplication and enable reuse by extracting shared characteristics into a generic method.
Code is improved via procedural abstraction.readability and makes internal implementation modifications easier.
The partitioning of a program into distinct subprograms is known as modularity.
By dividing programs into smaller, more manageable components, it aids in program complexity management.
Procedures may be generalized and reused with different input values or arguments by using parameters.
Reusable methods included in software libraries make it easier to create new applications.
Development can be accelerated by using code parts from libraries or other sources.
Libraries offer pre-written functionality, making it easier to create sophisticated applications.
Application program interfaces (APIs) define how operations in a library should behave and be used.
To comprehend the use and operation of APIs or libraries, documentation is essential.

       The Internet
 ✶ The internet is a worldwide network that uses common protocols to link computers.
 ✮ Information is sent in discrete units known as packets, which can follow distinct routes and move independently.
 ✶ By detecting mistakes and making sure packets arrive in the right order, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) guarantees dependable data transfer.
 ✶ The Internet Protocol (IP) transports data between devices and gives each one a unique address.

 ✮  Human-readable domain names, like google.com, are converted into IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS).
        
         Tolerance for Failure
 ✶ The capacity of a system to function even when some of its components fail is known as fault tolerance.
 ✶ The internet is built to withstand failures by dynamically rerouting data via alternate routes in the event that a connection breaks.
 ✶ Network infrastructure redundancy reduces the effect of outages and increases dependability.

  Parallel and Distributed Computing ✶ To increase efficiency, parallel computing splits a workload into smaller subtasks that execute concurrently on several processors.
 ✶ In distributed computing, several computers collaborate to solve an issue, frequently over a network.
