    <h1>Notes and Summary</h1>

    <h2>AP CSP Big Idea</h2>
    <div class="note-section">
        Here are my notes for the AP CSP College Board:
        - Topic 1.1: Collaboration allows us to take different views and remove bias from our code. There are many ways to collaborate with your partners in coding.
        - Topic 1.2: A computer innovation can be both online or physical. Many of the things we take for granted are computer innovations. To understand these innovations, we must ask questions such as: Why do they exist? What do they solve? And what do they make us do that wasn’t available before? There are many types of input, such as tactile, audible, visual, and text. Text also includes numerical values. Outputs are triggered by inputs. A computer program is a set of statements that are executed according to the rules of programming. Code segments are found in programs.
        - Topic 1.3: Programs are developed with investigators who need to determine the constraints, user concerns, interests, and requirements of a program. Developers brainstorm, then plan, and then develop their programs. Programs are created by teams, and every member of the team deserves credit. We must document whatever we do in case someone needs to find who did what or to give someone credit. Some programming languages offer comments, which helps us document without much trouble
        - Topic 1.4: There are many types of errors: logic errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, and overflow errors. Errors and programming go hand in hand. Errors are part of the process. Logic errors are caused by programmers making a mistake in the algorithm, while syntax errors occur when the typist causes a typo that results in the problem. A runtime error is where the program stops working while running (sometimes known as bugs). This can be caused by dividing by zero, etc. An overflow error is caused when the program tries calculating something that is outside the defined range of values. There are many cases and solutions to fix errors, such as test cases, hand tracing, visualization, debugging, and other output sources. The easiest errors to find and fix are syntax errors, while the hardest are usually logic errors. We can use test methods to solve these errors. Hand tracing is useful for loops and small programs. Programmers start testing when they start programming and begin answering the question of how this might work properly. We must think about what sort of input we could get in our algorithm. Programmers test their programs, then refine them.
