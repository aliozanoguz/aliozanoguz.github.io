    <h1>Notes and Summary</h1>

    <h2>AP CSP big idea </h2>
    <div class="note-section">
        Here are my notes for the AP CSP College Board:
        - Topic 1.1: Collabaration allows us to take diffrent views and romve bias from our cods. There are many ways to collabarate with your partners in coding.
        - Topic 1.2: A computer inovation can be both online or physical. Many of the things we take for granted are computer inovations. To understand these innovations we must ask question such as Why do they exist, what do they solve and what do they make us do that wasn’t available before. There are many types of input such as tactile, audiable, visual and text. Text also inclueds numerical values. Outputs are triggered by inputs. A computer program is a set of statments that are executed according to the rules of programing. Code segments are found in programs.
        - Topic 1.3: Programs are developed with investigators, whom they need to determine the constraints, user concerns and interests and the requirements of a program. Developers brainstorm then plan then develop their programs. Programs are created from teams and every member of the teem deserves credit. We must document whatever we do incase someone needs to fınd who dıd what or credit someone. Some programing languges offer comments whıch helps us document wıthout much trouble.
        - Topic 1.4: There are many types of errors. Logic errors, Syntax errors, run time error and overflow error. Errors and programming go hand in hand. Errors are part of the process. Logic errors are caused by programmers making an mistake in the algorithim while sytax errors can be when the typer causes an typo which resaults in this problem. A run time error is wehre the program stops working while running. Sometimes known as bugs. This can be caused by dividing by zero and etc. An overflow error is caused when the program tries calculating something that is outside of defined range of values. There are many cases and many solutions to fix errors such as test cases, Hand tracing, visualazation, debugging and other output sources. The easist errors to find and fix are syntax errors while the hardest are ussaly logic errors. We can use test methods to solve these errors. Hand tracing is useful for loops and small programs. programmers start testing when they start programming and start answering the question of how this might work properly. We must think what sort of input we could get on our algorithim. Programmers test their programs then refine their programs.
