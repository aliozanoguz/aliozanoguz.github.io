            <div class=" The main challenge I faced was that the website was not showing. At first, I changed the repository's name to what the website was supposed to be but it still did not work and gave an error code. İ was able to solve this error by deleting this repository and opening a new one with the same name and then using that. This allowed me to pass this problem. Another problem was the code ChatGPT wrote was to simple and did not have the parts I liked. For this problem, I gave different prompts and tested them out to see which worked best." contenteditable="true"></div>
