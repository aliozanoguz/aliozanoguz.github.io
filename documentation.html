            <div class="project-title">Project 1: Opening a Github Website</div>
            <div class="notes">The main challenge I faced was that the website was not showing. At first, I changed the repository's name to what the website was supposed to be, but it still did not work and gave an error code. I was able to solve this error by deleting this repository and opening a new one with the same name, then using that. This allowed me to pass this problem. Another problem was that the code ChatGPT wrote was too simple and did not have the parts I liked. For this problem, I gave different prompts and tested them out to see which worked best.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 2: Connect Four</div>
            <div class="notes">Once I started following the steps in the video, when I tested it out, it did not work. To solve this problem, I used previously created projects that worked and tried using their code to create a new code, and I was able to succeed.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 3: PhotoFrame</div>
            <div class="notes">The book on Swift clearly expressed the codes, and I followed the instructions and was able to finish without a problem. However, to upload it, I had to get help from İbrahim.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 4: Bouncy Ball</div>
            <div class="notes">To create this app, I started following the instructions in the book, but that did not work out, so I found a guide by Takis Kinis on YouTube and followed his video. I finished without a problem.</div>

        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 5: Mememaker</div>
            <div class="notes">I followed Takis Kinis on YouTube and watched his video on this app. When I followed his guide, I did not have any problems.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 6: Calculator</div>
            <div class="notes">This was the first app I did myself without any help from videos or the book, and it was very simple. I did not have any problems.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 7: Rock Paper Scissors</div>
            <div class="notes">This was the first very challenging app which I actually put in around 7 hours for. The videos just did not work, and I was struggling with the codes. To fix this, I got help from İbrahim.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 8: Color Picker</div>
            <div class="notes">This was my favorite application as it was fun to do, and I was able to complete it pretty quickly thanks to the video by Takis Kinis.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 9: Question Bot</div>
            <div class="notes">To complete this project, I had to watch videos, get help from my friends, and follow the book. I was able to complete it, but it is not able to answer every question (it is not supposed to as well; it is not missing codes).</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 10: Chat Bot</div>
            <div class="notes">You cannot talk fluently with this bot, but you are able to communicate for a few sentences at most. To create this app, I used the book. The most challenging part was the storyboard, which I was able to find and complete after a very long time.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Project 11: CS50</div>
            <div class="notes">At first, I tried coding this game myself, but I was not even close. Then I tried looking at CS50's Scratch to do it, but that was a very complicated project. I got motivated when I looked at Melis's project; I was not able to get to the exact level, but I was able to create a pretty similar project.</div>
