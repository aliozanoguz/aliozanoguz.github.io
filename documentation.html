                <p>The main tool i used was ChatGPT the reason i used this was to create an html code. After this step i asked ChatGPT to explain and understood the html codes bit by bit. </p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Challenges Faced</h3>
                <p>The main challenges i faced was the website was not showing. At first i changed the Repositarys name to what the website was supposed to be but it still did not work and gave an error code.İ was able to solve this error by deleting this repositary and openng a new one with the same name and then using that. This allowed me to pass this problem. Another problem was the code ChatGPT wrote was to simple and did not have the parts i liked. For this problem i gave diffrent prompts and tested them out to see which worked best.</p>
